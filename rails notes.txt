Intsalling Rails
----------------
Windows: Install using RubyInstaller

ExecJs Problem
--------------
This is due to sass and coffescript cannot be run
Just install NodeJs and add its install directory in PATH

Create New Rails App
--------------------
rails new [name-of-app]

Running Rails Server
--------------------
rails server  -> Usually localhost:3000

Scaffolding
-----------
rails generate scaffold [Name-Of-Model] field-name:type field-name2:type ..
ex. rails generate status name:string content:text

DB Migration
------------
Make DB migrations if you want to make changes to the database
rake db:migrate

Git and Github Steps
--------------------
git add .
git commit -m "[Commit Message]"
Create Github Repo
Add Remote using: git remote add ... (Given by github)
git push -u origin master

Make a copy of Jason's repository on my computer
git clone git@github.com:jasonseifer/treebook.git

Review the log of changes in the repository
git log

Install the dependencies of the project using Bundler
bundle

Create the databases for the application
rake db:create:all

Update the database definitions to their latest version
rake db:migrate

Bootstrap
---------
Download at put the Bootstrap.js, bootstrap.css, and images to
the respective folders in rails assets

Instead of deleting the scaffolds.css.scss, you can just empty its
content for it to feel like empty, since later on it will be still
generated when you add another scaffold to your project

Display a list of all routes in the rails application
rake routes
Note: Just add _path or _path(id) if you want to get a relative path of the route
ex. statuses_path or statuses_path(id)

Terminal Commands
-----------------
Add all changes to git to be committed in the next commit
git add .

View the current status of the git repository
git status

Commit the changes to git with a commit message
git commit -m "My commit message"

Configure the name and email address for git on your computer (only needed once per computer)
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "me@example.com"

Update the previous commit to change the author (used extremely rarely)
git commit --amend --reset-author

Interactivity
-------------
If you don't want to use coffeescript then just change the
.js.coffee into .js and change the comment style from #... to //...

Git Get Changes
---------------
git pull origin master

Sublime Tip: Use Ctrl+P to go to any file

Adding Authentication Using Devise
----------------------------------
-put gem 'devise' in your gemfile
-bundle
-rails generate devise:install # To install devise and to get more instructions
-follow the instructions from devise installation
Note: When adding route, be sure to delete the public/html default file from rails
	  as this file will be first loaded regardless if you have set a new route to index
-You can change route by putting this into your routes.rb:
  root to: 'controller#action'
  ex. root to: 'statuses#index'
  # You can view all the actions of a controller by opening the controller's respective file

To Create a model for authentication using devise:
--------------------------------------------------
rails generate devise [name-of-model]
ex. rails generate devise user

To Generate Views
------------------
rails generate devise:views

To Avoid Mass Asignment Error (When everybody can just register even for admin)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to user.rb or the model for your authentication and add your custom
fields to attr_accessible. (ex. :first_name, :last_name, etc)

Interactive Rails
------------------
rails console
ex. interactions:
user = Users.first # Gets the first user in the database
user.destroy # deletes the user from the database

Tip: Models / Classes in plural and capitalize form are used to represent models in database
